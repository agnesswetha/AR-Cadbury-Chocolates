   <li><p style="color:#FFD700">It is shaped like little <b>bubbles with soft creamy chocolate</b> inside.</li></p>
   <li><p style="color:#FFD700">The soft and round chocolate bubbles on the outside sit deliciously in the roof of your mouth, whilst the bubbly centre melts.</li></p>
   <li><p style="color:#FFD700">Dairy milk silk bubbly has the same smooth flavour that you would expect from cadburyâ€™s silk with the added twist of bubbles <b>(completely non-flavour altering)</b>.</p></li>
   <li><p style="color:#FFD700">It is a milk chocolate, so it is on the sweeter, milkier side.</li></p>
   </ul>
