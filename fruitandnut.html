  <li>Dairy Milk Fruit & Nut is one of those classic Indian chocolates that we love and have memories of from our childhood days.</li>
  <li>The classic flavour of Dairy Milk Chocolate along with <b>dried fruits and nuts</b> just brings back those memories.</li>
  <li>Some people love those raisins and some absolutely hate them but they still remain untouched in terms of loving chocolates in India.</li>
  <li>The taste of the Cadbury chocolates might have evolved over the years but it still remains a good memory down the lane and the only thing that has increased is the price of this Fruit & Nut bar.</li>
