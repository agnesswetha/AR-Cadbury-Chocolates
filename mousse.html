   <li><p style="color:#FFD700">Dairy milk silk mousse has the same smooth and classic taste of Cadbury silk chocolates with the <b>added twist of mousse which makes it fluffy, creamy, and thick.</b></p></li>
   <li><p style="color:#FFD700">The mousse bubbles simply make it a little bigger to bite into, a little airier when you are chewing with soft creamy chocolate inside.</li></p>
   <li><p style="color:#FFD700">The exquisite taste of softer, smoother and silkier silk lasts in your mouth longer than anything else.</li></p>
